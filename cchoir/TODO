 * Normalize log usage & names in instances, consoles, etc...
 * Log output line by line, not at each byte array received.
 * Handle non-0 return codes, raise an exception with last log
   lines maybe.
 * Add a 'step' scope manager that describe a step that can be used
   to split log (in gui for example).
 * Add a scope option on InstanceConsole to disable logging on stderr, stdout
   or both (to allow reading stdout for example)
 * Add a bash wrapper helper.
 * Think about 'component' system, to configure DNS for hosts, or http proxy
 * for example.
